The workshop is co-located with the ACM Recommender Systems Conference 2021 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The goal of the workshop was to capture the current state of evaluation and gauge whether there is—or should be—a different target that recommender systems evaluation should strive for. The workshop primarily addressed the question: “Where should we go from here as a community?” and aimed at coming up with concrete steps for action. We received 17 paper contributions and one abstract submission for the workshop. Each paper contribution received three reviews. We selected 12 papers for publication which will also be presented during the workshop. Furthermore, we accepted one abstract submission to be presented at the workshop. We would like to thank the members of the program committee for their valuable reviews and suggestions. We also thank the authors for their submissions and contributions to the workshop.","tags":[],"title":"Proceedings of the Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems Workshop 2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva Zangerle","Christine Bauer","Alan Said"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1632528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632273071,"objectID":"ab79d68f3673ab6d8c4e0e4841f8fedc","permalink":"http://multimethods.github.io/publication/zangerle-2021-perspectives/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:45.839142Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zangerle-2021-perspectives/","section":"publication","summary":"Evaluation is a cornerstone in the process of developing and deploying recommender systems. The PERSPECTIVES workshop brought together academia and industry to critically reflect on the evaluation of recommender systems. Particularly, the workshop aimed to shed light on the different, and maybe even diverging or contradictory perspectives on the evaluation of recommender systems. Papers reporting a reflection on problems regarding recommender systems evaluation and lessons learned were solicited. The workshop combined flash presentations of accepted papers, a keynote from industry, and an interactive part with discussions in break-out rooms as well as in the plenum. The workshop complemented the program of the main conference as it emphasized problems and lessons learned, fostered exchange integrating various perspectives on evaluation, and sought to move the recommender systems community forward as an outcome of the workshop.","tags":[],"title":"Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632528000,"objectID":"f603c3f3ce0af4e0adfd618b25c01645","permalink":"http://multimethods.github.io/events/perspectives2021_event/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/perspectives2021_event/","section":"events","summary":"Workshop on the Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES 2021) at RecSys 2021.","tags":["workshop","recsys","evaluation"],"title":"Workshop on the Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES 2021)","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624579200,"objectID":"60f80d55b749f9cf9e5d94b96f393995","permalink":"http://multimethods.github.io/events/tu01_umap2021_multimethods/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/tu01_umap2021_multimethods/","section":"events","summary":"Tutorial on Multi-Method Evaluation of Adaptive Systems at UMAP 2021.","tags":["tutorial","UMAP","multi-methods","evaluation","adaptive systems","recsys"],"title":"Multi-Method Evaluation of Adaptive Systems","type":"event"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1624233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385072,"objectID":"540f5bc38f45bfef79a6623d344d7ac2","permalink":"http://multimethods.github.io/publication/bauer-2021-multimethods-tutorial/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:46.692755Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bauer-2021-multimethods-tutorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Method Evaluation of Adaptive Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":["workshop"],"content":"We am happy to announce that we – Eva Zangerle, Christine Bauer, and Alain Said – will co-organize the workshop “Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)” at RecSys 2021.\nMore infos will follow soon.\n","date":1616112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616112000,"objectID":"ddcc8a6105893a15b3915c2f52399e20","permalink":"http://multimethods.github.io/post/perspectives_2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/perspectives_2021/","section":"post","summary":"We am happy to announce that we – Eva Zangerle, Christine Bauer, and Alain Said – will co-organize the workshop “Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)” at RecSys 2021.","tags":null,"title":"Workshop PERSPECTIVES 2021 @ RecSys 2021","type":"post"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":["tutorials"],"content":"Christine Bauer will hold a tutorial on Multi-Method Evaluation of Adaptive Systems at UMAP 2021.
