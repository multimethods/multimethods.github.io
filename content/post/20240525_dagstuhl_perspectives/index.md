We had a very intense, yet amazing, seminar at Dagstuhl.

Together with [Alan Said](https://www.alansaid.com), we organized the [Dagstuhl Seminar 24211: Evaluation Perspectives of Recommender Systems: Driving Research and Education](https://www.dagstuhl.de/24211).
It was incredible having so many brilliant people discussing topics around the evaluation of recommender systems with us. Thank you to everyone!
