A single evaluation method or measure is not able to evaluate all relevant aspects in a complex setting where a multitude of stakeholders are involved. We reason that employing a multi-method evaluation, where multiple evaluation methods or measures are combined and integrated, allows for getting a richer picture and prevents blind spots in the evaluation outcome.
