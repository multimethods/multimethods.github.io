abstract: "This report documents the program and the outcomes of the Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop 24352, 'Conversational Agents: A Framework for Evaluation (CAFE)', which brought together 22 distinguished researchers and practitioners from 12 countries. In this workshop, a new framework for the evaluation of conversational information access systems was developed, consisting of six major components: 1) goals of the systemâ€™s stakeholders, 2) user tasks to be studied in the evaluation, 3) aspects of the users carrying out the tasks, 4) evaluation criteria to be considered, 5) evaluation methodology to be applied, and 6) measures for the quantitative criteria chosen. An evaluation design begins with identifying the stakeholders, whose goals determine the criteria. Tasks and evaluation methodology should be chosen according to these decisions."
