abstract: 'In this paper, we focus on recommendation settings with multiple stakeholders with possibly varying goals and interests, and argue that a single evaluation method or measure is not able to evaluate all relevant aspects in such a complex setting. We reason that employing a multi-method evaluation, where multiple evaluation methods or measures are combined and integrated, allows for get- ting a richer picture and prevents blind spots in the evaluation outcome.'
